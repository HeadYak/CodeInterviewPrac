# CrackingTheCodingInterview

My attempts at the questions found in the book titled "Cracking the Coding Interview"

## Arrays and Strings

### [1. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?](./Arrays_Strings/as1.py)

### [2. Implement a function which reverses a null-terminated string.](Arrays_Strings/as2.py)

### [3. Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.](Arrays_Strings/as3.py)

### [4. Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.](Arrays_Strings/as4.py)
